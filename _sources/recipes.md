# Workflows for machine-readable chemical data 

FAIR data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reuseable by both humans and machines and "Fully AI-Ready". This section will provide atomized workflows for specific tasks related to managing machine-readable chemical data. Interactive examples are included as demonstrations that can be copied and executed through a Jupyter notebook or other Python based code. 

See the SAMPLE RECIPES for a range of example protocols developed by active community members.
