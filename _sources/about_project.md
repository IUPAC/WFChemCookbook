# About the IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook Project

This resource was initially formulated as an output of the 
[WorldFAIR D3.2 project](https://iupac.org/project/2022-028-1-024/) for the 
[WorldFAIR initiative](https://worldfair-project.eu/) (see below). The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook is intended to support 
the broader community in understanding how to work with machine-readable chemical data and implement the FAIR data 
principles. The site is designed to be a living community resource through the addition of new content as strategies evolve 
and the sharing and reuse of FAIR chemical data continues to increase. 
[Feedback](https://iupac.github.io/WFChemCookbook/feedback.html) and
