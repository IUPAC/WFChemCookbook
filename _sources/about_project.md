# About the IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook Project

This resources was initially formulated as an output of the 
[WorldFAIR D3.2 project](https://iupac.org/project/2022-028-1-024/) for the 
[WorldFAIR initiative](https://worldfair-project.eu/) (see below). The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook is intended to support 
the broader community in understanding how to work with machine-readable chemical data and implement the FAIR data 
principles. The site is designed to be a living community resource through the addition of new content as strategies evolve 
and the sharing and reuse of FAIR chemical data continues to increase. 
[Feedback](https://iupac.github.io/WFChemCookbook/feedback.html) and 
[contributions](https://iupac.github.io/WFChemCookbook/contributions.html) are welcome!

## WordFAIR Chemistry
The Committee on Data of the International Science Council ([CODATA](https://codata.org/)) and the Research Data 
Alliance (RDA) launched the [WorldFAIR Initiative](https://worldfair-project.eu/) in 2022 to advance 
implementation of the [FAIR data principles](https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/) within and across 
research domains. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ([IUPAC](https://iupac.org/)), known as the 
world authority on chemical nomenclature, terminology, and standardized methods of measurement, hosts the 
WorldFAIR Chemistry project to support broader data sharing of chemical data through collaboration with related disciplines 
and data science communities. The goal of [WorldFAIR Chemistry](https://iupac.org/project/2022-012-1-024) is to support the 
use of chemical data standards in research workflows to enable downstream data reuse through practical direction and 
resources.

*WorldFAIR “Global cooperation on FAIR data policy and practice” is funded by the EC HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-41 
Coordination and Support Action under Grant Agreement No. 101058393.*
