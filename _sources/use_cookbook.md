# How to use the Cookbook

This cookbook provides a range of protocols developed by active community members. These recipes target different 
tasks across a range of possible use cases for working with machine-readable chemical data (i.e., FAIR data). 
The aim is to present all materials with relevant chemistry examples, point to external content that are of high 
quality where available, reference IUPAC and community digital standards where appropriate, and engage the chemistry 
community in order to broaden the understanding of FAIR in chemistry.

The cookbook presents a collection of annotated code snippets and workflows for specific tasks in manipulating 
machine-readable chemical data and metadata. 

- Many of the recipes on this site take advantage of Juypter Notebooks to run Python code in the browser for an 
  interactive (and educational) feel for the user.
- Information on how, what and when a recipe might be useful is available in the collapsable 'header' below the 
  title of the recipe. 
- The header also includes bullets for skills and learning objectives 
- Ideas to further characterize the applicability of recipes are welcome (see feedback)!
