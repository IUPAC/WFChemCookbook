# Welcome to the IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook

The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook (FCCB) is intended to be an open, collaborate, community focused 
resource on how to work with FAIR data in chemistry. FAIR means findable, accessible, interoperable, 
and reusable and is the new paradigm for how chemists should share their data.

This first version of the FCCB is provided as a sampler of content that could be published in this
mode of dissemination.  We would apprecitate it if you could review the set of recipes available on 
the left, and provide feedback to the project group ([here](https://github.com/IUPAC/WFChemCookbook/issues)) and/or make suggestions of content or 
additonal dissemination mechanisms.
