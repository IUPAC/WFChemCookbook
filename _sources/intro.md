# Using the Cookbook

The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook is intended to be an open, collaborative, community focused resource on working with 
FAIR data in chemistry. FAIR data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable for machine processing 
{cite:p}`Wilkinson2016`, the new paradigm for reporting research data. This cookbook aims to support best practices 
using chemical data standards through practical, interactive tutorials, provided by the International Union of Pure 
and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) through the EU funded WorldFAIR project 
(see [About this project](https://iupac.github.io/WFChemCookbook/about.html)). 

## Recipes 
- Many of the recipes on this site will take advantage of Juypter Notebooks to run Python code 
 in the browser for an interactive (and educational) feel for the user.
- We have tried to provide useful information about each recipe in the collapsable 'header'
 that is below the title of the recipe.  We are hoping this provides users with some sense
 of the how, what and when a recipe might be useful.
- As part of the header we have included bullets for skills and learning objectives but have also
 thought to add use cases.  If you have any ideas about how we should characterize recipes we would love to 
 hear them!
