# Welcome to the IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook

Welcome to the IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook, a self-serve web-based toolbox of interactive demonstrations of 
community best practices in machine-readable chemical data management. The Cookbook is an openly accessible 
collaborative resource supported by IUPAC to exemplify the FAIR principles and standards in cheminformatics 
and provide hands-on executable content for experiential learning.
