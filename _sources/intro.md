# Welcome to the IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook

The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook (FCCB) is intended to be an open, collaborative, community focused 
resource on how to work with FAIR data in chemistry. FAIR means findable, accessible, interoperable, 
and reusable and is the new paradigm for how chemists should share their work/data. This resource
is provided by the Internatinal Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ([IUPAC](https://iupac.org/)),
a project funded by the EU funded [WorldFAIR project](https://worldfair-project.eu/).

## How you can help
This first version of the FCCB is provided as a sampler of content that will be published via this
mode of dissemination.  We would appreciate it if you could review the set of RECIPES available on 
the left, and provide feedback to the project group ([here](https://github.com/IUPAC/WFChemCookbook/issues)) 
and/or make suggestions of content or additional dissemination mechanisms.

We would also like to get feedback on the additional sections on the left, areas of content we anticipate
including as reference material for the recipes and other content.  The intent is to present all the 
material with relevant chemistry examples, point to external content that are of high quality where available,
reference IUPAC and community digital standards where appropriate, and engage the chemistry community in order
to broaden the understanding of FAIR in chemistry.
