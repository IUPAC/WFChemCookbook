# Contribute to the Cookbook! 

The Cookbook is an open, collaborative, community focused resource based on a broadly accessible online dynamic 
platform in the form of a Jupyter Book that supports the development and publication of executable content.
The content covers a range of activities for working with FAIR chemical data likely to be encountered by researchers, 
data scientists and many other stakeholders engaged in publishing and re-using chemical data. If you regularly 
work with digital chemical data and have useful approaches that could be demonstrated through a Jupyter Notebook, 
please consider contributing. Best practices for using standards and tools are emphasized and instructions for 
how to contribute materials are provided.
