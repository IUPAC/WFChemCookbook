Spectral data are common in many domains and may arise from a variety of instruments and instrumental techniques. In many cases, a spectrum is a table of observed values as a single variable changes (wavelength, time, mass-charge ratio...) but in other cases can be more complex as or the number of variables or the resolution increases.
