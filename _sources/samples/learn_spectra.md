# How to: FAIR formating of (multi, hyper)spectral data

Spectral data are common in many domains and may arise from a variety of instruments and instrumental techniques. In many cases, a spectrum is a table of observed values as a single variable changes (wavelength, time, mass-charge ratio...) but in other cases can be more complex as or the number of variables or the resolution increases. 

### What data?

- Raw
- Processed
- Peak list
- ROI


### What metadata?

- Authorship
- Instrument
- Procedure/technique
- Sample


### A simple minimal approach

XML+CSV


### A pool of formats (some are FAIRer than others)

### Checking the databases

- PubChem
- MassBank
- ChemSpider


### Some helpful software
