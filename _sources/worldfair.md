# WordFAIR Chemistry

The Committee on Data of the International Science Council ([CODATA](https://codata.org/)) and the Research Data 
Alliance (RDA) launched the [WorldFAIR Initiative](https://worldfair-project.eu/) in 2022 to advance 
implementation of the [FAIR data principles](https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/) within and across 
research domains. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ([IUPAC](https://iupac.org/)), known as the 
world authority on chemical nomenclature, terminology, and standardized methods of measurement, hosts the 
WorldFAIR Chemistry project to support broader data sharing of chemical data through collaboration with related disciplines 
and data science communities. The goal of [WorldFAIR Chemistry](https://iupac.org/project/2022-012-1-024) is to support the 
use of chemical data standards in research workflows to enable downstream data reuse through practical direction and 
resources.
