# The Joy of Cooking (FAIR data)

This cookbook provides a range of example protocols developed by active community members. These recipes target 
different tasks across a range of possible use cases for working with machine-readable chemical data (i.e., FAIR data). 
The aim is to present all materials with relevant chemistry examples, point to external content that are of high quality
where available, reference IUPAC and community digital standards where appropriate, and engage the chemistry community 
in order to broaden the understanding of FAIR in chemistry.

Working with data in terms of FAIR and in a digital environment means working with machine-readable data, therefore 
different activities, different steps to handle the data. This section provides a brief background on machine-readable 
data and the FAIR data principles in the context of chemistry, what you can do with machine-readable chemical data and 
the importance of preparing data to be FAIR and discoverable in domain repositories. 

In data science, a recipe describes a series of steps applied to a data set to prepare it for data analysis in a 
systematic away. Recipes can describe all the steps taken in a project from data ingestion to transformation to 
analysis to automate processes and share work with others. With recipes, you can prepare your dataset in a systematic 
and repeatable way. Recipes can cover many aspects of data preparation including normalization and joining multiple 
datasets. The recipes in this cookbook demonstrate actions…

## Themes
- FAIR describes attributes of machine-readable data that enables them to be reusable
  - Structure and consistency are important but there is no one rigid best way 
  - Standards are designed to encapsulate multiple attributes into convenient motifs and methods 
  - [Application of motifs/workflows enables FAIR attributes of data/metadata] 
- Common motifs in machine-readable chemical data (also in Culinary School) 
  - Chemical identification and structure representation 
  - Standard file formats for different data types 
  - Chemical metadata description 
- What you can do with machine-readable chemical data?
  - Enhance discovery 
  - Compile data 
  - Programmatically query for data 
- Making chemical Data FAIR  (more practicals in later sections) 
  - Data files
  - Data processing
  - Data description 
  - Data sharing 
  - Absolute “minimum” (meaning that would enable data to be discoverable and a reuser can then try to do something with
  it, even if not as efficiently as desirable) 

- Basic concepts – (also include concepts in glossary for specific linking) 
  - [setting the stage, the vernacular, this is what is happening here and you will come across that] 
  - machine-readable  
  - programmatic access/reuse 
  - Data exchange
  - Data export/import formats (e.g., JSON) 
  - Metadata 
  - Languages (e.g. python, R, markdown?) 
  - Platforms
  - Workspaces
  - Workflows
  - Provenance 
  - PIDs 
- How FAIR works? – (and other sections as appropriate) 
- Chemistry particulars – (and other sections as appropriate)
  - Data types
  - Motifs (identifiers, representations, schema, formats, ontologies) 
  - Standards 
  - Organizing principles of data resources 
  - There should also be something in here about FAIR is a scale and that anything you can do to improve the FAIRness 
  of your data is a good thing (with comments on the benefits of doing even the lowest level improvements).  SJC 12/5/23
