This section will review online resources where you can deposit/share and find/reuse FAIR chemical data. This material will be informed by the [WorldFAIR Chemistry D3.1 project](https://iupac.org/project/2022-027-1-024) related to Reporting Guidance for FAIR chemical data and other community resources, including the [NDFI4Chem Knowledgebase](https://knowledgebase.nfdi4chem.de/knowledge_base/) and the [ELIXIR FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/).
