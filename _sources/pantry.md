# Finding and sharing FAIR chemical data

This section will review online resources where you can deposit/share and find/reuse FAIR chemical data. This material 
will be informed by the [WorldFAIR Chemistry D3.1 project](https://iupac.org/project/2022-027-1-024) related to 
Reporting Guidance for FAIR chemical data and other community resources, including the 
[NDFI4Chem Knowledgebase](https://knowledgebase.nfdi4chem.de/knowledge_base/) and the 
[ELIXIR FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/).  In addition, efforts to inform best practice, 
like the [IUPAC FAIR Spec Project](https://iupac.org/project/2019-031-1-024/), will be highlighted.
