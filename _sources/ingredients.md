# Ingredients for FAIR Data

What are the ingredients that make data FAIR?

The FAIR Principles {cite:p}`wilkinson_fair_2016` provide a set of criteria that detail the characteristics
that determine if a set of data or resource is FAIR.  Note that these are general principles, and thus they
are qualities to bring to data and not requirements.  As such one can talk about the 'FAIRness' of data
and this implies a scale of FAIRness something that can now be evaluated using FAIR tools.

Below is a short description of what the four facets of FAIR mean, with examples specific to chemistry. For more 
detailed information on FAIR consult the excellent [NFDI4Chem Knowledge Base article](https://knowledgebase.nfdi4chem.de/knowledge_base/docs/topics/fair/) on the FAIR 
Principles.

## Findable
- F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
  This would be a DOI to dataset (e.g., from [DataCite](https://datacite.org/)) 
  of a research paper (from [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/))
- F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
  
- F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
- F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
## Accessible
- A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
  - A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
  - A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
- A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
## Interoperable
- I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
- I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
## Reusable
- R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
  - R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
  - R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
  - R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
