    "## Scenario\n",
    "Our group has a set of thermophysical data on over 8000 chemical substances.  We want to integrate into this dataset another physical property dataset so that we can do an analysis of the correlations of the thermophysical data with the chosen physical property of the substances (that are common to both sets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria for picking the physical property dataset: high quality, trusted, large, available with an open license, so I can publish the results and make the derived dataset open.\n",
    "- **High quality means**: unambiguous identification of each chemical substance, enough contextual information (metadata) to make the values scientifically useful, i.e., at least the composition of the solvent, the temperature and for volatile substances the pressure.\n",
    "- **Trusted means**: the provenance chain is reported with the data, and it shows that the data comes from a reputable source(s) and any aggregation and/or processing is documented in enough detail that the community can understand how the dataset has been created/provided."
