## What is PubChem?

PubChem [(https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (**Add References**) is a very popular chemistry information resource for biomedical research communities in many areas, including cheminformatics, chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, and drug discovery. PubChem's information content, collected from hundreds of data sources, is organized into multiple data collections, including Substance, Compound, BioAssay, Gene, Protein, Pathway, Cell Line, Taxonomy, and Patent (**Add Reference**). Substance archives the chemical data submitted by individual data sources and Compound stores the unique chemical structures extracted from Substance through chemical structure standardization. BioAssay contains biological assay descriptions and test results deposited by assay data providers. The record identifiers (IDs) used in Substance, Compound, and BioAssay are called Substance ID (SID), Compound ID (CID), and Assay ID (AID), respectively. The other data collections (i.e., Gene, Protein, Pathway, Cell Line, Taxonomy, and Patent) provide alternative views of PubChem data, related to a specific gene, protein, pathway, cell line, taxon, and patent document, respectively. Each record in the data collections has a dedicated web page (called a Summary page), which presents information available in PubChem for that record. This page also presents relevant annotations collected by PubChem from authoritative data sources.
