    "<u><b>Package</b></u>\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing a Python script, it's often necessary to use functionality that is not included in the Python standard library. One way to access this additional functionality is by importing Python packages into your script. These packages, also known as modules, provide pre-built functionality and code that can be easily integrated into your script, saving you the time and effort of having to write everything from scratch. They can include functions, classes, or other objects that are ready to use or extend, and are written by other developers to solve specific problems or tasks. In addition, importing packages can also help to keep your code organized and maintainable, by breaking it up into reusable and functional blocks. In summary, we import packages into scripts to leverage pre-built functionality and take advantage of the expertise of the Python community, allowing us to focus on the specific problem we are trying to solve.\n",
    " \n",
    "<b><u>Comment</u></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a comment is a piece of text that is ignored by the interpreter when the code is executed. Comments are used to explain the purpose and logic of the code, and to make it easier for other people (or yourself) to understand and maintain the code. Comments can be a single line or span multiple lines and can start with a # symbol or be encapsulated by tiple quotes \"\"\" \"\"\". The text within the comment is only intended for human readers. Comments are very useful to add explanations and context to code, also it can help to keep track of the progress, problems or ideas you had when working in a script. Use them liberally.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b><u>Method</u></b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "A method is a function that is associated with an object. It is defined inside a class, and it can access and manipulate the attributes and state of the object it is associated with. Methods contain functionality that is often useful for the work you are doing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b><u>Data Strucutre</u></b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "In Python (and in computer science in general), a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory so that it can be efficiently accessed and modified.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b><u>Float</u></b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "A float (short for \"floating-point number\") is a type of numeric data that can represent decimal values. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b><u>Function</u></b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "In Python, a function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions provide a way to organize your code into logical, modular chunks that can be easily reused and tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python function is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, a pair of parentheses (), and a colon :. The code inside the function is indented under the definition line.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><u>Dictionary</u></b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "A dictionary is a built-in data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Dictionaries are also commonly known as associative arrays or hash maps. They are similar to lists or arrays in other programming languages, but the elements in a dictionary are accessed via keys rather than an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><u>Variable</u></b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "In Python, a variable is a named location in memory that is used to store a value. A variable can be thought of as a \"container\" that holds a value, and the value can be of any data type (e.g., a number, a string, a list, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a variable in Python, you simply give it a name and assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).\n",
    "  \n",
    "<b><u>Doc String</u></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A docstring in Python is a string that appears at the top of a module, class, or function definition. Docstrings are used to provide a brief description of what the code does, as well as any information on the arguments, return values, and other details of the code. \n",
    "    \n",
    "<b><u>Virtual Environment</u></b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "You may have multiple Python projects happening at once. A virtual environment is a named, isolated copy of Python that has its own files and packages. Anything done inside a virtual environment is specific to that environment and won’t affect any other projects. All the dependencies and packages you install will be sandboxed inside the environment you are using. You should therefore have a separate virtual environment for each separate project.\n",

If JCAMP-DX is a fully supported format of the spectrophotometer, then the sample level metadata available in the raw data file could be user–defined or mandatory. The metadata content also depends on mapping from the spectrophotometer native software to JCAMP-DX {cite} Davies2019. Sample level metadata should be supplemented using the file structure defined in 3.2 below.\n",

Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n",
