    "## About OPSIN\n",
    "OPSIN is a web tool for converting an IUPAC systematic name into chemical identifiers, chemical markup language (CML) XML and images of molecules.  It is written in Java (GitHub repository) and accessed via a [web form](https://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk) (for humans), or its [API](https://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/instructions.html) (for machines).  More information about OPSIN can be found here ([website](https://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/information.html)) or here ([paper](https://pubs.acs.org/articlesonrequest/AOR-PcYgSy87ettZWfqyvHmN))."

    "## Step 4: Extract the formula of the substance\n",
    "An InChI string contains the molecular formula of the compound as part of the string.  Using regular expressions (formatted strings that match patterns in other text strings), also referred to as 'regex', you can find patterns in strings and extract them, or use them to create new strings.  Below, the '1S' part of a standard InChI string is used to anchor a regular expression to match the molecular formula (see note).  The string \"(.+)\" means 'match any character multiple times, in a sequence until you find a ')' character'. The '?' is required to stop the regex from being 'greedy', matching the string all the way to the last '/' in the InChI string, rather than stopping at the first, like we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "For ionic compounds and salts of organics the InChI code adds their formula in the form 'cation.anion', e.g., [ethylammonium nitrate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6432248) InChI=1S/C2H7N.NO3/c1-2-3;2-1(3)4/h2-3H2,1H3;/q;-1/p+1).  This is not the normal format for a molecular formula, but you can generate one by totaling each element. Also note that the cation and anion formulae do not include the charges.  That is represented in the charge layer (q) at the end of the InChI.\n",
