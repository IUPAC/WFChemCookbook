# Tools for Enabling FAIR Data

What tools can you use to make your data FAIR(er)?  In this section of the cookbook we plan to share resources that
can enable researchers to make their own data FAIRer than it currently is.  These might include:
- online resources (like [FAIRSharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/))
- how to set up Excel spreadsheets in a way that enables data reuse
- creating unique identifiers for your research data, projects etc.
