# About this Cookbook

The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook is intended to be an open, collaborative, community focused resource on working 
with FAIR data in chemistry. This community resource aims to provide a range of practical and re-usable training 
materials that demonstrate how to manage digital data files and content. Our goal is to get more practical tools 
& tips in the hands of practicing chemists and others working with digital chemical data, to lower barriers and 
smooth the adoption of best practices for sharing and reusing FAIR chemical data. The content primarily consists 
of actionable recipes for a range of tasks to prepare and deposit FAIR machine-enabled chemical data, identify 
and extract chemically relevant metadata, and compile and validate chemical data files using online tools.

FAIR data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable for machine processing {cite:p}`Wilkinson2016`. 
FAIR chemical data need to be machine-readable, and this can be an unfamiliar scenario for many researchers 
and other stakeholders involved with publishing and managing experimental data. This cookbook aims to support 
best practices for sharing and reusing chemical data aligned with the technical criteria for FAIR 
machine-readable data. Practical, interactive tutorials based on common workflows and readily accessible 
online tools for working with digital content augment broader guidance.

The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook is designed to be an evolving resource for the chemistry community. It is 
supported by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as part of the WorldFAIR 
Initiative (see About this project).
