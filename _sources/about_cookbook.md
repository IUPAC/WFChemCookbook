# About the IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook

The website has been developed to provide researchers, librarians, data scientists 
and others interested in the chemical sciences with training material for:
- preparing and depositing chemical data
- identifying and extracting chemical relevant metadata
- validation of chemical data

The included resources present material that focuses of activities, approaches and formats that
support the training through reference to the Findable Accesible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)
principles.

The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook (IFCC) is designed to be an evolving resource for the chemistry
community, both in terms of scale and breadth of content and is supported by the International
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
