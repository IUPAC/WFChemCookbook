# About this Cookbook

The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook is intended to be an open, collaborative, community focused resource on working with 
FAIR data in chemistry. This community resource aims to provide a range of practical and re-usable training materials 
that demonstrate how to manage digital data files and content. Our goal is to get more practical tools & tips in the 
hands of practicing chemists and others working with digital chemical data, to lower barriers and smooth the adoption 
of best practices for sharing and reusing FAIR chemical data. The content primarily consists of actionable recipes 
for a range of tasks to prepare and deposit FAIR machine-enabled chemical data, identify and extract chemically 
relevant metadata, and compile and validate chemical data files using online tools. 

FAIR data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable for machine processing {cite:p}`Wilkinson2016`. 
FAIR chemical data need to be machine-readable, and this can be an unfamiliar scenario for many researchers and 
other stakeholders involved with publishing and managing experimental data. This cookbook aims to support best 
practices for sharing and reusing chemical data aligned with the technical criteria for FAIR machine-readable 
data. Practical, interactive tutorials based on common workflows and readily accessible online tools for 
working with digital content augment broader guidance. 

The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook is designed to be an evolving resource for the chemistry community. It is 
supported by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as part of the
WorldFAIR Initiative (see About this project).
