# About this Cookbook

This resource was initially formulated as an output of the [IUPAC WorldFAIR Chemistry project](https://iupac.org/project/2022-028-1-024/), for the 
[WorldFAIR initiative](https://worldfair-project.eu/) (see below). The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook is intended to support the broader 
community in understanding how to work with machine-readable chemical data and implement the FAIR data principles. 
The site is designed to be a living community resource through the addition of new content as strategies evolve 
and the sharing and reuse of FAIR chemical data continues to increase. Feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Cookbook development 

This Cookbook is created online with Jupyter Book. Content is generated locally and managed through a GitHub repository.
This infrastructure enables the following requirements at the content creation level:
- Open and FAIR development and deployment
- Support for a diverse set of user personas
- Agile development and adaptation to user needs
- Community engagement for long term stability
- Documentation at user, contributor and administrator levels

## WorldFAIR Chemistry 

The Committee on Data of the International Science Council ([CODATA](https://codata.org/)) and the Research Data 
Alliance ([RDA](https://rd-alliance.org/)) launched the [WorldFAIR Initiative](https://worldfair-project.eu/) in 
2022 to advance implementation of the [FAIR data principles](https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/) 
within and across research domains. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ([IUPAC](https://iupac.org/)),
known as the world authority on chemical nomenclature, terminology, and standardized methods of measurement hosts 
the WorldFAIR Chemistry project in a concerted effort to support broader data sharing of chemical data through 
collaboration with related disciplines and data science communities. The goal of 
[WorldFAIR Chemistry](https://iupac.org/project/2022-012-1-024) is to support the use of chemical data standards in 
research workflows to enable downstream data reuse through practical direction and resources.
