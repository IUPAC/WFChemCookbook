Working with chemical data you quickly realize there are many situations where you want to augment a dataset with 
chemical identifiers, however they are not easy to find.  This case arises where the compound/ion/complex/alloy you
searching on is not very common and thus not in general databases like PubChem, Common Chemistry, or UniChem.  However,
as long as you have enough information to come up with a legitimate IUPAC name for a compound you are in luck.

OPSIN (Open Parser for Systematic IUPAC Nomenclature) is a relatively simple website where you can enter the IUPAC name
for a compound and retrieve many common identifiers for the structure.  OPSIN has been around in its current form since 
2009 and was developed by Daniel Lowe as part of his PhD.  Daniel has supported the site since then and continues to
add updates as he can, based on user issues/requests.

OPSIN can be used by humans via the homepage where a single input box allows you to enter a valid IUPAC name (see figure below).  If you
don't have an IUPAC name, and you don't have time to learn all the naming rules, the site will return an error with 
information that the algorithm could not interpret.  While this might seem like a big negative for the site, it can
be used to fix misspelling of systematic names amd it is really useful as a teaching tool where you give students a
structure and ask them to name it, checking the names with OPSIN.  For data science OPSIN also has an [API](https://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/instructions.html) and returns
information back in JSON for easy use within scripting languages and other tools.

OPSIN can deal with names that include [greek letters and superscripts](https://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/instructions.html). 
It also has the capability to interpret mixtures of substances. This is useful for situations like getting identifiers for
compounds with waters of hydration (try 'copper sulfate hexahydrate' or 'copper sulfate pentahydrate'), solvates 
(try '(2-(Diphenylphosphino)ethyl)-trichloro-tin dichloromethane' or '(2-(Diphenylphosphino)ethyl)-trichloro-tin 
dichloromethane (1:2)'), or alloys (try 'aluminum magnesium cobalt (2:5:13)' or 'aluminum magnesium cobalt (3:3:4)').

Overall, OPSIN is an indispensable resource that is a goto when all else fails.
