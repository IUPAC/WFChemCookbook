# Cookbook development

This Cookbook is created online with Jupyter Book. Content is generated locally and managed through a GitHub repository.
This infrastructure enables the following requirements at the content creation level: 
- Open and FAIR development and deployment
- Support for a diverse set of user personas
- Agile development and adaptation to user needs
- Community engagement for long term stability
- Documentation at user, contributor and administrator levels
