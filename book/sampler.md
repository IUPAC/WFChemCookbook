# Sampler Edition - we need your input! 

Welcome to our new Cookbook! 

We are launching our prototype with a sampling of recipes to encourage early input to this project. The recipes target different tasks across a range of possible use cases for working with machine-readable chemical data (i.e., FAIR data). We also plan to include additional reference material for supporting FAIR data workflows. The intent is to present all materials with relevant chemistry examples, point to external content that are of high quality where available, reference IUPAC and community digital standards where appropriate, and engage the chemistry community in order to broaden the understanding of FAIR in chemistry.

Please review the **SAMPLE RECIPES** and **FUTURE CONTENT** areas, provide feedback and share your ideas for additional recipes. 
* [Feedback & suggestions](https://github.com/IUPAC/WFChemCookbook/issues/new/choose) 
* [Questionnaire](https://forms.gle/mnPiXpnWwf7928wi9) 

Our overall goal is to get practical tools & tips in the hands of practicing chemists and those who support them to lower barriers and smooth the adoption of best practices for sharing and re-using FAIR chemical data.
