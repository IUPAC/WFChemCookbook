# Checking your chemical data/metadata

This section will review protocols for confirming the completeness and consistency of chemical data and metadata files, for example the [checkCIF](https://checkcif.iucr.org/) service for Crystallographic Information Files (CIF). This material will also be informed by the [WorldFAIR Chemistry D3.3 project](https://iupac.org/project/2022-029-1-024) related to [Protocol Services](https://iupac.github.io/WFChemProtocols/intro.html) for standardized programmatic access to chemical data, and other community resources.
