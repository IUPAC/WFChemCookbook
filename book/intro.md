# Welcome to the IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook

The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook is intended to be an open, collaborative, community focused resource on working with FAIR data in chemistry. FAIR data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable for machine processing {cite:p}`Wilkinson2016`, the new paradigm for reporting research data. This cookbook aims to support best practices using chemical data standards through practical, interactive tutorials, provided by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) through the EU funded WorldFAIR project (see [About this project](https://iupac.github.io/WFChemCookbook/about.html)). 

*WorldFAIR “Global cooperation on FAIR data policy and practice” is funded by the EC HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-41 Coordination and Support Action under Grant Agreement No. 101058393.*
