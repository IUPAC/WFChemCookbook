To apply the FAIR principles for data management to produce digital data objects that contain raw, spectral and metadata to enable current and future researchers in the reanalysis and visualisation of UV/Vis spectroscopic data."

    "\n",
    "#### What is Python?\n",
    "    \n",
    "From the official python website, Python.org:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### What is Jupyter/a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Jupyter (formerly IPython Notebook) is an open-source project that lets you easily combine MarkDown text and executable Python source code on one canvas called a notebook. They are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc.) as well as executable documents which run the code to perform the data analysis. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### What is Anaconda?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Anaconda can be thought of as a one-stop shop for all things Python and data science. It’s almost an umbrella; by downloading Anaconda you also get Python, Jupyter notebooks and a whole host of other useful programmes. It is also a package manager and virtual environment manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing the tools\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to install Python is through the package and virtual environment manager Anaconda. Anaconda is free and open source and the Individual Edition can be installed from https://www.anaconda.com/.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once Anaconda is installed you can create a virtual environment, load Jupyter into the environment and run this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running the notebook (on your computer)\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Make sure Anaconda is installed on your computer\n",
    "2) Use the Anaconda navigator (or the command line) to create a virutal environment\n",
    "3) Enter the virtual environment\n",
    "4) Install Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib and Numpy (all can be done through Anaconda)\n",
    "5) Follow this link, for instructions to install jcamp https://pypi.org/project/jcamp/\n",
    "6) Launch Jupyter, navigate to the file you stored this notebook in and launch this notebook\n",
    "7) You can edit code chunks by clicking on them and typing \n",
    "8) You can run code chunks by clicking on them and pressing play (in the banner above) or by pressing shift+enter"

    "## 5. Glossary of Python terms\n",
    " \n",
    "### Package\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing a Python script, it's often necessary to use functionality that is not included in the Python standard library. One way to access this additional functionality is by importing Python packages into your script. These packages, also known as modules, provide pre-built functionality and code that can be easily integrated into your script, saving you the time and effort of having to write everything from scratch. They can include functions, classes, or other objects that are ready to use or extend, and are written by other developers to solve specific problems or tasks. In addition, importing packages can also help to keep your code organized and maintainable, by breaking it up into reusable and functional blocks. In summary, we import packages into scripts to leverage pre-built functionality and take advantage of the expertise of the Python community, allowing us to focus on the specific problem we are trying to solve.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Comment\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a comment is a piece of text that is ignored by the interpreter when the code is executed. Comments are used to explain the purpose and logic of the code, and to make it easier for other people (or yourself) to understand and maintain the code. Comments can be a single line or span multiple lines and can start with a # symbol or be encapsulated by tiple quotes \"\"\" \"\"\". The text within the comment is only intended for human readers. Comments are very useful to add explanations and context to code, also it can help to keep track of the progress, problems or ideas you had when working in a script. Use them liberally.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Method\n",
    "    \n",
    "A method is a function that is associated with an object. It is defined inside a class, and it can access and manipulate the attributes and state of the object it is associated with. Methods contain functionality that is often useful for the work you are doing, e.g. def for beer_lambert in the exemplar code above (section 4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Data Structure\n",
    "    \n",
    "In Python (and in computer science in general), a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory so that it can be efficiently accessed and modified.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Float\n",
    "    \n",
    "A float (short for \"floating-point number\") is a type of numeric data that can represent decimal values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Function\n",
    "    \n",
    "In Python, a function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions provide a way to organize your code into logical, modular chunks that can be easily reused and tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python function is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, a pair of parentheses (), and a colon :. The code inside the function is indented under the definition line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary\n",
    "    \n",
    "A dictionary is a built-in data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Dictionaries are also commonly known as associative arrays or hash maps. They are similar to lists or arrays in other programming languages, but the elements in a dictionary are accessed via keys rather than an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable\n",
    "    \n",
    "In Python, a variable is a named location in memory that is used to store a value. A variable can be thought of as a \"container\" that holds a value, and the value can be of any data type (e.g., a number, a string, a list, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a variable in Python, you simply give it a name and assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Doc String\n",
    "\n",
    "A docstring in Python is a string that appears at the top of a module, class, or function definition. Docstrings are used to provide a brief description of what the code does, as well as any information on the arguments, return values, and other details of the code. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Virtual Environment\n",
    "    \n",
    "You may have multiple Python projects happening at once. A virtual environment is a named, isolated copy of Python that has its own files and packages. Anything done inside a virtual environment is specific to that environment and won’t affect any other projects. All the dependencies and packages you install will be sandboxed inside the environment you are using. You should therefore have a separate virtual environment for each separate project."
