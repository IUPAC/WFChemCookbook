# FAIR Techniques

The cookbook is meant to provide practical approaches to different data tasks to inspire others to improve their own 
data practices. This section will introduce basic techniques on how to work with machine-readable data with particular 
emphasis on chemical data nuances and ways chemical data can be made more FAIR, when it is initially shared and for 
reusing data that are not fully FAIR. Techniques should be relatively easy to implement into common workflow(s) and 
give tangible results/improvements.
