## The Spectrum of FAIRness for Chemical Data

## (Minimal) Components for FAIR Chemical Data
- Openly shared in a proper data repository 
- Data available in an open (standard) format (and in the original format from the instruments) 
- READEME file to document
    - globally unique, citable, and persistent identifiers (PID, e.g., ORCID, InChI)
    - affiliated article citation
    - methods and other technical details
    - dataset structure and organization
    - license and term of use
