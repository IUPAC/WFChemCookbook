# IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook
The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook is an open, collaborate, community focused resource on how to work with FAIR data in chemistry. FAIR means findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable and is the new paradigm for how chemists should share their data.

## Usage

See the [cookbook](https://iupac.github.io/WFChemCookbook/howtos_identifiers.html) for a user friendly, interactive portal for these resources.

The contents of this repository are designed to use the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) framework to generate a simple to navigate and easy to maintain set of reference materials for getting started leveraging common and powerful chemical information tooling.

## Developer instructions

See the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## About this project 

The Committee on Data of the International Science Council ([CODATA](https://codata.org/)) and the Research Data Alliance ([RDA](https://rd-alliance.org/)) have recently launched the [WorldFAIR Initiative](https://worldfair-project.eu/) to advance implementation of the [FAIR data principles](https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/) within and across research domains. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ([IUPAC](https://iupac.org/)), known as the world authority on chemical nomenclature, terminology, and standardized methods of measurement, is leading the [WorldFAIR Chemistry project](https://iupac.org/project/2022-012-1-024) in a concerted effort through collaboration with related disciplines and data science communities to support broader data sharing of chemical data. The goal of WorldFAIR Chemistry is to support the use of chemical data standards in research workflows to enable downstream data reuse through practical direction and resources.

This project corresponds to [Deliverable 3.2] of the WorldFAIR Chemistry project. The main scope of work is to develop an online community resource of practical and re-usable training materials that demonstrate how to manage digital data files and content.

*WorldFAIR “Global cooperation on FAIR data policy and practice” is funded by the EC HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-41 Coordination and Support Action under Grant Agreement No. 101058393.*
