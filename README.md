# IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook
The IUPAC FAIR Chemistry Cookbook is an open, collaborate, community focused resource on how to work with FAIR data in chemistry. FAIR means findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable and is the new paradigm for how chemists should share their data.

## Usage

See the [cookbook](https://iupac.github.io/WFChemCookbook/howtos_identifiers.html) for a user friendly, interactive portal for these resources.

The contents of this repository are designed to use the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) framework to generate a simple to navigate and easy to maintain set of reference materials for getting started leveraging common and powerful chemical information tooling.
